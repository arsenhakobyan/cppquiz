ОТВЕТЫ:
1) By making all member functions constant.
2) By making at least one member function as pure virtual function.    ￼
3) By declaring it abstract using the static keyword.
4) By declaring it abstract using the virtual keyword.

ОТВЕТ РАЗВЕРНУТЫЙ:
Abstract class is the one which doesn't have any object. And pure virtual
function is the one which doesn't have any definition in the base class but it
is overridden in derived class.

So by defining pure virtual class, how can we make it abstract because we can
still create an object of the class and make it normal class.
