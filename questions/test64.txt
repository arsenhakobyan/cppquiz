ОТВЕТЫ:
1) A reference can never be null.
2) A reference once established cannot be changed.
3) Reference doesn't need an explicit dereferencing mechanism.
4) All of the above.

4) All of the above.

ОТВЕТ РАЗВЕРНУТЫЙ:
A pointer can be re-assigned any number of times while a reference can not be
re-seated after binding.
Pointers can point nowhere (NULL), whereas reference always refer to an
object.
You can't take the address of a reference like you can with pointers.
There's no "reference arithmetics" (but you can take the address of an object
pointed by a reference and do pointer arithmetics on it as in &obj + 5).
