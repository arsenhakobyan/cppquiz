ОТВЕТ РАЗВЕРНУТЫЙ:
A scope is a region of the program and broadly speaking there are three
places, where variables can be declared:
  - Inside a function or a block which is called local variables,
  - In the definition of function parameters which is called formal parameters.
  - Outside of all functions which is called global variables.

Variables that are declared inside a function or block are local variables.
They can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of
code. Local variables are not known to functions outside their own. Following
is the example using local variables:

Variables declared in blocks of if,else-if,else are local to the block they
were declared in.
