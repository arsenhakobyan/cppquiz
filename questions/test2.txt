ОТВЕТ РАЗВЕРНУТЫЙ:

<br>
<p> After the above code executes, i will equal 6, but j will equal 5.</p>

<p> Understanding the reason for this is fundamental to understanding how the unary increment (++) and decrement (--) operators work in C++.</p>

<p> When these operators precede a variable, the value of the variable is modified first and then the modified value is used. For example, if we modified the above code snippet to instead say int j = ++i;, i would be incremented to 6 and then j would be set to that modified value, so both would end up being equal to 6.</p>

<p> However, when these operators follow a variable, the unmodified value of the variable is used and then it is incremented or decremented. That’s why, in the statement int j = i++; in the above code snippet, j is first set to the unmodified value of i (i.e., 5) and then i is incremented to 6.</p>
