</div>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
</code></pre>

ОТВЕТЫ:
1) Use the realloc function from libc
2) Delete the existing array, then allocate a new array and copy the data from the old array to the new array
3) Allocate a new array, copy the data from old array to the new array and then delete the old array
4) It is not possible to do such an operation in C++

ПРАВИЛЬНЫЙ ОТВЕТ:
3) Allocate a new array, copy the data from old array to the new array and
then delete the old array

<br> <br>
ОТВЕТ РАЗВЕРНУТЫЙ:
You can not use realloc, because realloc may call free on memory allocated
with new which is bad. You can do the same thing realloc does manually, but
make sure not to delete the original array until after copying the data. Also
you may want to check the size of the new array. If the new array is smaller
than the old one, you may not need to do the reallocation depeding on the
business logic.
