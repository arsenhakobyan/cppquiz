ОТВЕТ РАЗВЕРНУТЫЙ:
An abstract type is defined largely as one that can't be created. You can
create subtypes of it, but not of that type itself. The CLI will not let you
do this.

An abstract class has a protected constructor (by default) allowing derived
types to initialize it.

For example, the base-type Stream is abstract. Without a derived type where
would the data go? What would happen when you call an abstract method? There
would be no actual implementation of the method to invoke.
