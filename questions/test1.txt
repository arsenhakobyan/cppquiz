ОТВЕТ РАЗВЕРНУТЫЙ:<br>
<p> The answer is not -25. Rather, the answer (which will surprise many) is 4294967271, assuming 32 bit integers. Why?</p>

<p> In C++, if the types of two operands differ from one another, then the
operand with the “lower type” will be promoted to the type of the “higher
type” operand, using the following type hierarchy (listed here from highest
type to lowest type): long double, double, float, unsigned long int, long int,
unsigned int, int (lowest).</p>

<p> So when the two operands are, as in our example, 25u (unsigned int) and 50 (int), the 50 is promoted to also being an unsigned integer (i.e., 50u). </p>

<p> Moreover, the result of the operation will be of the type of the operands.  Therefore, the result of 25u - 50u will itself be an unsigned integer as well.  So the result of -25 converts to 4294967271 when promoted to being an unsigned integer.  </p>
